\chapter{Publications}
\label{chap:publications}

This chapter presents the three published works that form the scholarly core of the PhD, arranged chronologically (starting with earliest) to reflect the progression of the research. It builds on earlier chapters, which established the thesis aims, objectives, and the development of the Thonny-py5mode software. Together, these publications mark key milestones in the research journey, spanning the design of Python-based curricula, the exploration and development of new tools, and the empirical evaluation of Thonny-py5mode through a user study. The list below situates each publication within the broader stages of the PhD:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Publication \ref{sec:no-starch} $-$ Stage: Processing.py and curriculum foundations.}  
This phase focused on establishing a curriculum for teaching Python through visual learning contexts, culminating in the sole-authored book \textit{\nameref{sec:no-starch}}. This book captures and formalises the educational approaches that initially framed the research.

\item \textbf{Publication \ref{sec:mtap} $-$ Stage: Transition to new tools and the development of Thonny-py5mode.}  
The discontinuation of Processing.py created a gap for a new Python-based creative coding environment. This led to the development of Thonny-py5mode: a plugin intended to replace and extend Processing's Python Mode. The \textit{\nameref{sec:mtap}} article positions Thonny-py5mode within the broader context of Python creative coding tools, highlighting its contribution to programming education.

\item \textbf{Publication \ref{sec:jise} $-$ Stage: Empirical testing and evaluation.}  
This component of the research involved an empirical evaluation of Thonny-py5mode in a 100-level university Python course. The \textit{\nameref{sec:jise}} article reports on this study, assesses the plugin's effectiveness through the lens of Task--Technology Fit, and discusses its broader implications for related educational contexts.

\end{enumerate}

The \nameref{chap:presentation-outputs} chapter documents the talks, workshops, and demonstrations that underpinned the publications presented here. Figure~\ref{fig:publications-chart} maps the three publications onto the PhD timeline---using their submission rather than publication dates---thereby illustrating the formative role of presentation outputs in their development.

The \textit{Publications} column lists the three works discussed in this chapter, shown in \textbf{bold black type}. Within this column, several \textcolor{gray}{\textit{--- Thonny-py5mode...}} entries indicate individual Thonny-py5mode releases. Dotted-outline cells mark the periods of producing the \textit{Creative Works} (covered in the \nameref{chap:creative-works} chapter) and conducting the empirical evaluation of Thonny-py5mode (\textit{TTF Study}). The \textit{Notes} column summarises the processes and steps that defined each stage.

Viewed within the context of this PhD by folio/publication, the sole-authored book and two peer reviewed Q1/Q2 journal articles balance practical impact with scholarly rigour. \textit{\nameref{sec:no-starch}} serves as a resource for educators integrating Python-based creative coding into curricula, while the journal articles contribute to academic discussion surrounding Python tools for visual learning contexts. Collectively, these publications address four research objectives outlined in the ``\nameref*{chap:introduction}'' chapter: \hyperref[ro:tool-development]{Tool Development}, \hyperref[ro:educational-materials]{Educational Materials}, \hyperref[ro:empirical-evaluation]{Empirical Evaluation}, and \hyperref[ro:broader-dissemination]{Broader Dissemination}.

As outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:literature-review-conceptual-map} in the ``\nameref*{chap:literature-review}'' chapter, the journal articles engage with much of the relevant literature, as do the \nameref{chap:presentation-outputs} and, to a lesser extent, the \nameref{chap:creative-works}. Given the folio/publication thesis format, some of the literature in the journal articles unavoidably overlaps with the \nameref*{chap:literature-review}. Specifically---

\begin{itemize}

\item While the ``\nameref*{chap:literature-review}'' chapter also covers prominent creative coding environments, the article \textit{\nameref{sec:mtap}} extends this analysis to explore Python-3-specific creative coding environments in greater depth.

\item The other article, \textit{\nameref{sec:jise}}, reiterates some of the general and introductory literature on creative coding environments in a more condensed form. However, it also provides an additional review of scholarship supporting the Task--Technology Fit framework, which is central to its study.

\end{itemize}

The next section (\ref{sec:no-starch}) reviews the content and development of the book \textit{\nameref{sec:no-starch}}, which cannot be reproduced in full here because of its length and copyright restrictions. Following that, the subsequent sections (\ref{sec:mtap}, \ref{sec:jise}) present the two journal articles in their preprint (submitted) form, which do not incorporate revisions made after peer review. Publishers permit the distribution and archiving of these versions, which exclude publisher formatting and instead follow the style and conventions of the thesis.

\section{Chapter Summary}

In summary, this chapter presented the three publications that form the scholarly core of the thesis. Together, they trace the research journey from curriculum design with Processing.py, through the development of Thonny-py5mode, to its empirical evaluation in a university setting. These works complement the \nameref{chap:literature-review} and \nameref{chap:software} chapters, while connecting to the dissemination efforts documented in \nameref{chap:presentation-outputs} and \nameref{chap:creative-works}. Collectively, they demonstrate the originality, significance, and scholarly validation of the research, achieved through peer reviewed rigour.

The following chapter, \nameref{chap:presentation-outputs}, continues the folio narrative, documenting a series of prominent academic and professional conference presentations that laid the groundwork for the three publications.
