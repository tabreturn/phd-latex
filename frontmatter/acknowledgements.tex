\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I want to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors, Dr Michelle Douglas and Dr Aaron Bere, for their invaluable guidance and support, crucial to the successful transition to and completion of my PhD at Torrens University Australia. Also, thank you to TUA for supporting my studies.

I extend my heartfelt thanks to my initial (Victoria University of Wellington) supervisors, Dr Craig Anslow and Dr Karsten Lundqvist, for their excellent guidance in preparing my successful research proposal and seeing me through to full PhD candidature. 

I am profoundly grateful to the creators, maintainers, and community surrounding Processing, particularly its Python-related projects, py5 and Processing.py. Your efforts have significantly enriched educational and creative coding communities, inspiring my students and me. 

Also, a special thank you to all those whose support and collaboration assisted in completing and disseminating the publications, presentations, and creative works contained herein---this includes funding bodies and sponsors, editors and peer reviewers, study participants, conference and exhibition organisers, and the publishers and academic platforms that provided opportunities to present and share this work with a broader audience.

%\textcolor{white}{Finally, to the PBRF: thank you for exemplifying how research assessment mechanisms can entrench exclusivity, ensuring that those outside the preferred networks remain undervalued.}
