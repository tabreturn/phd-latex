\chapter{Declaration of Originality}

This thesis is my own work, and to the best of my knowledge, it contains no materials previously published or written by another person, and no materials which have been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma at Torrens University Australia or any other institution, except where I have made due acknowledgement. I acknowledge that copyright of published work contained within this thesis resides with the copyright holder(s) of those works. Any contribution made to the research by others is explicitly acknowledged.

\section*{Use of Generative AI}

I have used AI-assisted tools to support the preparation of this thesis. Specifically, I employed Grammarly~\cite{grammarly_inc_grammarly_2025} extensively for proofreading and editing, and ChatGPT (OpenAI)~\cite{openai_inc_chatgpt_2025} and Claude (Anthropic)~\cite{anthropic_pbc_claude_2025} to scaffold parts based on my drafts and to assist with summary sections. In combination with Grammarly, I also used these large language models to refine, condense, and improve the clarity of some language. I confirm that I restricted the use of these tools to my draft text, avoiding any submission of sensitive research data or participant information. All intellectual contributions, interpretations, analyses, and arguments remain my own, except where I have made due acknowledgement. Moreover, I reviewed any AI output to verify, critically examine, and refine it before any integration into the thesis content.
