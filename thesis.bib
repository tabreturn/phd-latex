	abstract = {Enormous quantities of data go unused or underused today, simply because people can't visualize the quantities and relationships in it. Using a downloadable programming environment developed by the author, Visualizing Data demonstrates methods for representing data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more. How do the 3.1 billion A, C, G and T letters of the human genome compare to those of a chimp or a mouse? What do the paths that millions of visitors take through a web site look like? With Visualizing Data , you learn how to answer complex questions like these with thoroughly interactive displays. We're not talking about cookie-cutter charts and graphs. This book teaches you how to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets with the help of a powerful new design and prototyping tool called "Processing". Used by many researchers and companies to convey specific data in a clear and understandable manner, the Processing beta is available free. With this tool and Visualizing Data as a guide, you'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features that will bring users to your site over and over. This book teaches you: The seven stages of visualizing data – acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interact How all data problems begin with a question and end with a narrative construct that provides a clear answer without extraneous details Several example projects with the code to make them work Positive and negative points of each representation discussed. The focus is on customization so that each one best suits what you want to convey about your data set The book does not provide ready-made "visualizations" that can be plugged into any data set. Instead, with chapters divided by types of data rather than types of display, you'll learn how each visualization conveys the unique properties of the data it represents – why the data was collected, what's interesting about it, and what stories it can tell. Visualizing Data teaches you how to answer questions, not simply display information.},

	doi = {10.1145/3586183.3606719},
	abstract = {Creative coding tasks are often exploratory in nature. When producing digital artwork, artists usually begin with a high-level semantic construct such as a "stained glass filter" and programmatically implement it by varying code parameters such as shape, color, lines, and opacity to produce visually appealing results. Based on interviews with artists, it can be effortful to translate semantic constructs to program syntax, and current programming tools don't lend well to rapid creative exploration. To address these challenges, we introduce Spellburst, a large language model (LLM) powered creative-coding environment. Spellburst provides (1) a node-based interface that allows artists to create generative art and explore variations through branching and merging operations, (2) expressive prompt-based interactions to engage in semantic programming, and (3) dynamic prompt-driven interfaces and direct code editing to seamlessly switch between semantic and syntactic exploration. Our evaluation with artists demonstrates Spellburst's potential to enhance creative coding practices and inform the design of computational creativity tools that bridge semantic and syntactic spaces.},

Numerous libraries and IDEs support creative coding, however there has been little consideration of how the environments themselves might be designed to serve these twin goals. To investigate this gap, we implemented and used an experimental editor to teach a sequence of college and high-school creative coding courses. In the first year, we conducted a log analysis of student work (𝑛=39) and surveys regarding prospective features (𝑛=25). These guided our implementation of common enhancements (e.g. color pickers) as well as uncommon ones (e.g. bidirectional shape editing). In the second year, we studied the effects of these features through logging (𝑛=39+) and survey (𝑛=23) studies. Reflecting on the results, we identify opportunities to improve creativity- and novice-focused IDEs and highlight tensions in their design—as in tools that augment artistry or efficiency but may be perceived as hindering learning.},

At different educational levels, computational thinking can be developed and assessed through solving ill-defined problems. This paper introduces computational thinking in the context of Higher Education creative programming activities. In this study, we engage undergraduate students in a creative programming activity using Scratch. Then, we analyze the computational thinking scores of an automatic analysis tool and the human assessment of the creative programming projects. Results suggested the need for a human assessment of creative programming while pointing the limits of an automated analytical tool, which does not reflect the creative diversity of the Scratch projects and overrates algorithmic complexity.},

	abstract = {Learning how to program can be a cumbersome task even for students who enroll in courses in the Computer Science field. It is well documented that computer programming courses have high failure rates and high drop out. Even at the initial stage of computer introduction courses, novice students often reveal difficulties and strong reactions to this subject. However, computer programming has been recognized as an essential skill and a necessary element in education in many different areas. This work reflects on the experience provided by teaching a Creative Programming course, being held as part of a Master’s degree curriculum in School of Media Arts and Design (ESMAD), at Polytechnic of Porto (P.PORTO), in Portugal. The students’ background is not uniform, therefore pedagogical learning strategies had to be adapted to these multidisciplinary backgrounds to foster student attention and interest, as well as being able to achieve the goals of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming. This article reflects on the strategies to teach programming for noninformatics: drifting from the traditional functional way, like developing a program or product to solve a problem, to the usage of creative coding and generate interactive animations, while simultaneously achieving the ambitious goals of learning programming concepts and paradigms.},

Though the impetus to develop the program originated in the computer science department, the department was not suited to cover all of the topics necessary, even with the addition of several new courses. Accordingly, the program was established as interdisciplinary, with major components in computer science and art. The computer science portion of the curriculum emphasizes basic computing concepts, especially programming. The program has evolved from a somewhat disparate collection of courses into a tighter, more integrated, educational experience, with a high graduate placement in the industry each year.},

	abstract = {Creative computing is an approach to computing education which emphasises the creation of interactive audiovisual software and an art-school influenced pedagogy. Given this emphasis on Dewey’s "learning by doing”, we set out to investigate the processes students use to develop their programs. We refer to these processes as the students’ ‘coding behaviour’, and we expect that understanding it will provide us with valuable information about how students learn in our creative computing classes. As existing metrics were not sufficient, we introduce a new set of quantitative metrics to describe coding behaviours. The metrics consider factors such as students’ vocabulary use and development, how fast and how much they alter the functionality of code over time and how they iterate on their code through text insert and delete operations. Many of our lessons involve providing students with demonstrator code which they use as a base for the development of their programs, so we use demo code as an entry point to our dataset. We look at programs students have written through developing the demo code in a dataset of over 16,000 programs. We clustered the demo code using the set of descriptive metrics. This lead to a set of clusters containing programs which are associated with distinct coding behaviours. Four was the ideal number of clusters for cluster density and separation. We found that the clusters had distinct behaviour patterns, that they were associated with different instructors and that they contained demo programs with different lengths.},

This paper collects and classifies this literature, identifies important work and mediates it to computing educators and professional bodies.We identify research that gives well-supported advice to computing academics teaching introductory programming.

	abstract = {Deciding what to teach novices about programming and what programming language to use is a common topic for debate. Should an industry relevant programming language be taught, or should a language designed for teaching novices be used? Typically, these questions are raised at university level, but in this paper we address them from a high school perspective.We present a case study with a twofold goal: (1) examining how programming can be introduced at high school level, and (2) evaluating how suitable the programming language Python is to support both teachers and learners in this process. During the school year 2004/2005, an introductory programming course was given to four student groups in two different high schools. The students enjoyed programming and learnt to think in terms of re-use and interfaces. In addition, we found that many features of Python facilitated both teaching and learning (for instance, a simple and flexible syntax, immediate feedback, easy-to-use modules and strict requirements on proper indentation).Our findings support results from previous studies in that students have difficulties in dealing with abstract concepts - even though the syntax for implementing these is simple. In addition, compared to university students, high school students are young and have necessarily not yet developed the writing skills required for producing proper documentation. The course was designed to be well suited for high school students in general, but still all participants were boys. Since high schools should provide all-round learning to all students, we, as do all computer science teachers, face the challenge of making programming more appealing to girls.},

This workshop aims to bring together experts in creative coding and interaction design to discuss and conceptualise frameworks for the practice of media multiplicities.

Despite these suggestions, coding music has not reached a wider audience of young children, and the approach’s potential to engage them has not been thoroughly demonstrated. To facilitate the adoption of coding music activities, we created M-flow, a flow-based programming platform that allows young children to code music intuitively from the outset. Then, we developed a standards-aligned curriculum that teachers applied in their fourth-grade classrooms. Surveys indicate that children were greatly engaged, the experience successfully exposed them to and increased their self-efficacy toward programming. Our results indicate that with the appropriate coding platform, coding music can be a powerful way to engage children in CS.},

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreaterLive coding focuses on improvising content by coding in textual interfaces, but this reliance on low level text editing impairs usability by not allowing for high level manipulation of content. VJing focuses on remixing existing content with graphical user interfaces and hardware controllers, but this focus on high level manipulation does not allow for fine-grained control where content can be improvised from scratch or manipulated at a low level. This thesis proposes the code jockey practice (CJing), a new hybrid practice that combines aspects of live coding and VJing practice. In CJing, a performer known as a code jockey (CJ) interacts with code, graphical user interfaces and hardware controllers to create or manipulate real-time visuals. CJing harnesses the strengths of live coding and VJing to enable flexible performances where content can be controlled at both low and high levels. Live coding provides fine-grained control where content can be improvised from scratch or manipulated at a low level while VJing provides high level manipulation where content can be organised, remixed and interacted with. To illustrate CJing, this thesis contributes Visor, a new environment for live visual performance that embodies the practice. Visor's design is based on key ideas of CJing and a study of live coders and VJs in practice. To evaluate CJing and Visor, this thesis reflects on the usage of Visor in live performances and feedback gathered from creative coders, live coders, and VJs who experimented with the environment.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

Python has emerged as a prevalent programming language, leading many institutions and universities to adopt it as the default language for their programming curriculum. This paper examines the transition from Java to Python as the main programming language of the curriculum at the University of Helsinki. The shift to a new language of instruction is a significant and critical undertaking that profoundly impacts the curriculum. Thus, it requires careful consideration and meticulous execution. To assess our success in the change, we analyzed the pass rates and average student grades across multiple courses before and after the change. Moreover, we administered a questionnaire to teaching assistants experienced in Java and Python and collected weekly feedback from students in the first implementations of the renewed course. Based on our findings, the change was successfully executed, as the learning outcomes were not adversely affected by the language change. Thus, this article likely offers valuable insights for educational institutions considering similar transitions.},

(BBN). Logo’s design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget’s constructivism and Marvin Minsky’s artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo’s foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables. Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer’s potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in the Logo language development as it encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of web applications has essentially transformed modern browsers into small but powerful operating systems. Upon visiting a website, user devices run implicitly trusted script code, the execution of which is confined within the browser to prevent any interference with the user's system. Recent JavaScript APIs, however, provide advanced capabilities that not only enable feature-rich web applications, but also allow attackers to perform malicious operations despite the confined nature of JavaScript code execution. In this paper, we demonstrate the powerful capabilities that modern browser APIs provide to attackers by presenting MarioNet: a framework that allows a remote malicious entity to control a visitor's browser and abuse its resources for unwanted computation or harmful operations, such as cryptocurrency mining, password-cracking, and DDoS. MarioNet relies solely on already available HTML5 APIs, without requiring the installation of any additional software. In contrast to previous browser-based botnets, the persistence and stealthiness characteristics of MarioNet allow the malicious computations to continue in the background of the browser even after the user closes the window or tab of the initial malicious website. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a prototype system, MarioNet, that is compatible with all major browsers, and discuss potential defense strategies to counter the threat of such persistent in-browser attacks. Our main goal is to raise awareness regarding this new class of attacks, and inform the design of future browser APIs so that they provide a more secure client-side environment for web applications.},

	abstract = {Many guest languages are implemented using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as a host environment. There are two major implementation choices: custom compilers and so-called hosted interpreters. Custom compilers are complex to build but offer good performance. Hosted interpreters are comparatively simpler to implement but until now have suffered from poor performance. We studied the performance of hosted interpreters and identified common bottlenecks preventing their efficient execution. First, similar to interpreters written in C/C++, instruction dispatch is expensive on the JVM. Second, Java’s semantics require expensive runtime exception checks that negatively affect array performance essential to interpreters. We present two optimizations targeting these bottlenecks and show that the performance of optimized interpreters increases dramatically: we report speedups by a factor of up to 2.45 over the Jython interpreter, 3.57 over the Rhino interpreter, and 2.52 over the JRuby interpreter, respectively. The resulting performance is comparable with that of custom compilers. Our optimizations are enabled by a few simple annotations that require only modest implementation effort; in return, performance increases substantially.},

	abstract = {This research aims at exploring the potential to extend the creative capabilities of a pen plotter. While commercial pen plotters offer limited possibilities for controlling a pen’s pressure or its height in relation to the drawing surface, developing an advanced pen-lift mechanism would allow for dynamically controlling the height of a writing or drawing implement with adequate resolution. These improvements permit using an ink brush or pen with a flexible tip to modulate the stroke weight of the drawn lines. Designing and building additions and advancements to an experimental pen plotter based on a laser engraving machine allows for practical experimentation, resulting in drawings aiding in validating the claimed improvements. In addition, a theoretical look, based on literature and expert interviews, provides insight to pen plotters, their operation and use, their history, their significance in algorithmic art, and their current revival reflected in an active community. The experimentation with the improved pen plotter resulted in ten drawings which illustrate the gained potential as a creative tool. Some of which are based on algorithms generating lines with varying stroke weights. Others are halftone images based on photographs and drawn as lines with dynamically changing thickness. A recent revival, especially in generative art and design, can be observed despite pen plotters having long been replaced by other hard copy devices. This research might encourage other pen plotter community members, which are often driven by innovation while generously sharing their knowledge, to pursue similar experiments.},

	abstract = {In recent years the blockchain and the digital innovation has caused paradigm shifts across very disparate sectors of our society (Rangone and Busolli, 2021). In such a context, the non-fungible tokens (NFT) more specifically have started to transform everything from finance to art (Kashevarova and Starikova, 2022; Qin et al., 2021). There’s good reason to suspect that, once their full potential is realized, almost no industry will be left untouched. Although the technology has been around for a while, NFTs took off in 2020 and have been growing in popularity ever since, particularly in the digital art world (Habrel, 2022; Dragos Popescu, 2021; Trautman, 2021). In that year, the rapid growth of the NFT sector and its numerous mentions in mainstream media surprised many in the crypto space. In 2021, many NFTs from the most popular NFT collections, such as crypto kittens, crypto punks, and Decentraland land plots, were sold for insanely high prices. According to DappRadar (2021), a service that records the buying and selling of NFTs, the trading volume of NFTs reached a record high of \$22 billion in 2021. This success can be attributed to mainstream businesses entering the NFT industry. As today’s hottest digital assets, non-fungible tokens have taken the arts and investment worlds by storm. Some claim that NFTs are the future of artwork and that the next Vincent van Gogh will be a computer programmer. Many see NFTs as viable, profitable investments tailored for younger, digitally savvy buyers. Detractors wonder if NFTs are a short-term novelty. Through a theoretical approach, this paper investigates the scenarios and the possible criticalities of the NFTs’ spread in the specific sector of art business.},

	abstract = {In 2021, online marketplaces such as Nifty and Opensea gained popularity, and digital art creations, including Beeple’s pieces, made headlines worldwide. This attracted traditional fine art practitioners, artists, dealers, digital content creators, and crypto entrepreneurs who wanted to participate in this trend. Several significant investment and token-funded projects took place in Asia, fueling high hopes of revolutionizing the art market with nonfungible token (NFT) technology. However, the numbers suggest a different story, as NFT transactions have reached a historical low. Critics from both sides challenge the value of NFTs, and there is minimal empirical research on the topic of blockchain technologies in the art market. This paper explores the challenges and misunderstandings in the art market through the lens of the researcher’s insight as an art tech entrepreneur. Its aim is to provide an explorative account of the use cases of NFT and blockchain technology vis-a-vis the traditional art market. The paper discusses the current work in progress at the Art ID Standard consortium, covering decentralized identity, blockchain, and use cases, and provides insights into the implications of these challenges for artists, collectors, and the broader art ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The research examines the phenomenon of creative programming as an example of the interaction between art and technology. The historical prerequisites for its emergence and various tools for its implementation are analysed. Systematization and analysis of existing platforms and computer languages for creative programming made it possible to classify them chronologically, according to principles of work, and technical characteristics. The main ways of using creative programming in different periods were explored in analysing contemporary art projects that used creative programming. Thus, The Algobabez duo used real-time programming with SuperCollider software at their performances. The capabilities of MAX/MSP made it possible to implement the performer-computer interaction in Inter-sax-tive by composer Nicolas Scherzinger. In the interactive project Messa di Voce, the sound is transformed with the help of the Openframeworks software into graphics, which affects the performers. In other cases, the software was written specifically for an art project. In the Abraham project, artist and programmer Gene Kogan tries to create an autonomous artificial artist who has his own will and can create authentic visual images. As part of the multidisciplinary interactive project "Hakanaï", we can see how code written specifically for the project, allows performer to interact with a visual projection (mapping) that, in turn, interacts with the performer’s moves. We prove that creative programming has become a promising, independent tool of creativity within modern interdisciplinary artistic practices, borders of which continue to expand thanks to the open code approach and the involvement of a community of like-minded people.},

Game engine is a software that facilitates the production of games for platforms such as desktops, consoles, and mobile devices [1]. In addition to specialized editors, game engines provide ready-made functionalities that can be used by users. A great advantage of using the game engine is the possibility of their reuse. Game engines are an example of software isolating rigid logic and game rules, from easily modifiable and expandable components, which can be used repeatedly in a way that does not require great modifications. This article is an attempt to perform a comparative analysis of three engines to create games: CryEngine, Unreal Engine, and Unity. The criteria for comparison will be technical capabilities and factors influencing the popularity and acceptance of engines by users. The aim of this article is to show the strengths and weaknesses of engines and to present the differences between these tools.},

We also demonstrate that GPT-4 refactoring of existing code can significantly improve that code along several established metrics for code quality, and we show that GPT-4 can generate tests with substantial coverage, but that many of the tests fail when applied to the associated code. These findings suggest that while AI coding tools are very powerful, they still require humans in the loop to ensure validity and accuracy of the results.},

This paper aims to explore how well ChatGPT can perform in an introductory-level functional language programming course. In our systematic evaluation, we treated ChatGPT as one of our students and demonstrated that it can achieve a grade B- and its rank in the class is 155 out of 314 students overall. Our comprehensive evaluation provides valuable insights into ChatGPT's impact from both student and instructor perspectives. Additionally, we identify several potential benefits that ChatGPT can offer to both groups.

	abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered remarkable advancements across diverse code-related tasks, known as Code LLMs, particularly in code generation that generates source code with LLM from natural language descriptions. This burgeoning field has captured significant interest from both academic researchers and industry professionals due to its practical significance in software development, e.g., GitHub Copilot. Despite the active exploration of LLMs for a variety of code tasks, either from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) or software engineering (SE) or both, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive and up-to-date literature review dedicated to LLM for code generation. In this survey, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a systematic literature review that serves as a valuable reference for researchers investigating the cutting-edge progress in LLMs for code generation. We introduce a taxonomy to categorize and discuss the recent developments in LLMs for code generation, covering aspects such as data curation, latest advances, performance evaluation, ethical implications, environmental impact, and real-world applications. In addition, we present a historical overview of the evolution of LLMs for code generation and offer an empirical comparison using the HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench benchmarks across various levels of difficulty and types of programming tasks to highlight the progressive enhancements in LLM capabilities for code generation. We identify critical challenges and promising opportunities regarding the gap between academia and practical development. Furthermore, we have established a dedicated resource GitHub page (https://github.com/juyongjiang/CodeLLMSurvey) to continuously document and disseminate the most recent advances in the field.},

Due to its wide range of applications and the potential of recent works, AIGC developments – especially in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) – have been attracting significant attention, and this survey focuses on comprehensively reviewing such advancements in ML/DL. AIGC methods have been developed for various data modalities, such as image, video, text, 3D shape, 3D scene, 3D human avatar, 3D motion, and audio – each presenting unique characteristics and challenges. Furthermore, there have been significant developments in cross-modality AIGC methods, where generative methods receive conditioning input in one modality and produce outputs in another. Examples include going from various modalities to image, video, 3D, and audio. This paper provides a comprehensive review of AIGC methods across different data modalities, including both single-modality and cross-modality methods, highlighting the various challenges, representative works, and recent technical directions in each setting. We also survey the representative datasets throughout the modalities, and present comparative results for various modalities. Moreover, we discuss the typical applications of AIGC methods in various domains, challenges, and future research directions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732},
	abstract = {This paper explores the limits of the current generation of large language models for program synthesis in general purpose programming languages. We evaluate a collection of such models (with between 244M and 137B parameters) on two new benchmarks, MBPP and MathQA-Python, in both the few-shot and fine-tuning regimes. Our benchmarks are designed to measure the ability of these models to synthesize short Python programs from natural language descriptions. The Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP) dataset contains 974 programming tasks, designed to be solvable by entry-level programmers. The MathQA-Python dataset, a Python version of the MathQA benchmark, contains 23914 problems that evaluate the ability of the models to synthesize code from more complex text. On both datasets, we find that synthesis performance scales log-linearly with model size. Our largest models, even without finetuning on a code dataset, can synthesize solutions to 59.6 percent of the problems from MBPP using few-shot learning with a well-designed prompt. Fine-tuning on a held-out portion of the dataset improves performance by about 10 percentage points across most model sizes. On the MathQA-Python dataset, the largest fine-tuned model achieves 83.8 percent accuracy. Going further, we study the model's ability to engage in dialog about code, incorporating human feedback to improve its solutions. We find that natural language feedback from a human halves the error rate compared to the model's initial prediction. Additionally, we conduct an error analysis to shed light on where these models fall short and what types of programs are most difficult to generate. Finally, we explore the semantic grounding of these models by fine-tuning them to predict the results of program execution. We find that even our best models are generally unable to predict the output of a program given a specific input.},

	abstract = {Large-scale pre-training has recently emerged as a technique for creating capable, general purpose, generative models such as GPT-3, Megatron-Turing NLG, Gopher, and many others. In this paper, we highlight a counterintuitive property of such models and discuss the policy implications of this property. Namely, these generative models have an unusual combination of predictable loss on a broad training distribution (as embodied in their "scaling laws"), and unpredictable specific capabilities, inputs, and outputs. We believe that the high-level predictability and appearance of useful capabilities drives rapid development of such models, while the unpredictable qualities make it difficult to anticipate the consequences of model deployment. We go through examples of how this combination can lead to socially harmful behavior with examples from the literature and real world observations, and we also perform two novel experiments to illustrate our point about harms from unpredictability. Furthermore, we analyze how these conflicting properties combine to give model developers various motivations for deploying these models, and challenges that can hinder deployment. We conclude with a list of possible interventions the AI community may take to increase the chance of these models having a beneficial impact. We intend this paper to be useful to policymakers who want to understand and regulate AI systems, technologists who care about the potential policy impact of their work, and academics who want to analyze, critique, and potentially develop large generative models.},

We present the first grounded theory analysis of how programmers interact with Copilot, based on observing 20 participants—with a range of prior experience using the assistant—as they solve diverse programming tasks across four languages. Our main finding is that interactions with programming assistants are bimodal : in acceleration mode , the programmer knows what to do next and uses Copilot to get there faster; in exploration mode , the programmer is unsure how to proceed and uses Copilot to explore their options. Based on our theory, we provide recommendations for improving the usability of future AI programming assistants.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, significantly enhancing developer productivity. However, for a vast number of users with minimal coding knowledge, LLMs provide little support, as they primarily generate isolated code snippets rather than complete, large-scale project code. Without coding expertise, these users struggle to interpret, modify, and iteratively refine the outputs of LLMs, making it impossible to assemble a complete project. To address this issue, we propose Self-Rectified Large-Scale Code Generator (SRLCG), a framework that generates complete multi-file project code from a single prompt. SRLCG employs a novel multidimensional chain-of-thought (CoT) and self-rectification to guide LLMs in generating correct and robust code files, then integrates them into a complete and coherent project using our proposed dynamic backtracking algorithm. Experimental results show that SRLCG generates code 15x longer than DeepSeek-V3, 16x longer than GPT-4, and at least 10x longer than other leading CoT-based baselines. Furthermore, they confirm its improved correctness, robustness, and performance compared to baselines in large-scale code generation.},

To explore the implications that AI code generators have on introductory programming, we conducted a controlled experiment with 69 novices (ages 10-17). Learners worked on 45 Python code-authoring tasks, for which half of the learners had access to Codex, each followed by a code-modification task. Our results show that using Codex significantly increased code-authoring performance (1.15x increased completion rate and 1.8x higher scores) while not decreasing performance on manual code-modification tasks. Additionally, learners with access to Codex during the training phase performed slightly better on the evaluation post-tests conducted one week later, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Of interest, learners with higher Scratch pre-test scores performed significantly better on retention post-tests, if they had prior access to Codex.},

	abstract = {Novice programmers often struggle through programming problem solving due to a lack of metacognitive awareness and strategies. Previous research has shown that novices can encounter multiple metacognitive difficulties while programming. Novices are typically unaware of how these difficulties are hindering their progress. Meanwhile, many novices are now programming with generative AI (GenAI), which can provide complete solutions to most introductory programming problems, code suggestions, hints for next steps when stuck, and explain cryptic error messages. Its impact on novice metacognition has only started to be explored. Here we replicate a previous study that examined novice programming problem solving behavior and extend it by incorporating GenAI tools. Through 21 lab sessions consisting of participant observation, interview, and eye tracking, we explore how novices are coding with GenAI tools. Although 20 of 21 students completed the assigned programming problem, our findings show an unfortunate divide in the use of GenAI tools between students who accelerated and students who struggled. Students who accelerated were able to use GenAI to create code they already intended to make and were able to ignore unhelpful or incorrect inline code suggestions. But for students who struggled, our findings indicate that previously known metacognitive difficulties persist, and that GenAI unfortunately can compound them and even introduce new metacognitive difficulties. Furthermore, struggling students often expressed cognitive dissonance about their problem solving ability, thought they performed better than they did, and finished with an illusion of competence. Based on our observations from both groups, we propose ways to scaffold the novice GenAI experience and make suggestions for future work.},

	abstract = {This review presents a comprehensive analysis of two emerging paradigms in AI-assisted software development: vibe coding and agentic coding. While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.},

	abstract = {Abstract Sustainable education is a crucial aspect of creating a sustainable future, yet it faces several key challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and a lack of awareness and engagement. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to address these challenges and enhance sustainable education by improving access to quality education, creating personalized learning experiences, and supporting data-driven decision-making. One outcome of using AI and Information Technology (IT) systems in sustainable education is the ability to provide students with personalized learning experiences that cater to their unique learning styles and preferences. Additionally, AI systems can provide teachers with data-driven insights into student performance, emotions, and engagement levels, enabling them to tailor their teaching methods and approaches or provide assistance or intervention accordingly. However, the use of AI and IT systems in sustainable education also presents challenges, including issues related to privacy and data security, as well as potential biases in algorithms and machine learning models. Moreover, the deployment of these systems requires significant investments in technology and infrastructure, which can be a challenge for educators. In this review paper, we will provide different perspectives from educators and information technology solution architects to connect education and AI technology. The discussion areas include sustainable education concepts and challenges, technology coverage and outcomes, as well as future research directions. By addressing these challenges and pursuing further research, we can unlock the full potential of these technologies and support a more equitable and sustainable education system.},

	abstract = {This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbot’s hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85\% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62\%) and GPT-4 (73\%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3\% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34\% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbot’s clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. Emphasizing the ethical aspects of the project, the bias principle led to the discrimination of gendered reasons for 83\% and the GDPR-iPad-like procedures to anonymity were followed. The chatbot\&apos;s productivity points to its ability to make coding education available to everyone and to give 24/7 aid to students in some not well-funded schools. Future work will expand multilingual support through localized datasets and culturally adapted examples, integrate gamification to enhance engagement, and develop collaborative learning features. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.},

By evaluating prompting strategies at different levels of complexity, we identify that simplest and straightforward prompting strategy yields best code generation results. Additionally, adding a CoT-like preliminary confirmation step would further increase the success rate. Our results reveal that while GPT-4 marginally outperforms GLM-4, the difference is minimal for average users. In our simplified evaluation model, we see a remarkable 30 to 100-fold increase in code generation efficiency over traditional coding norms. Our GenAI Coding Workshop highlights the effectiveness and accessibility of the prompting methodology developed in this study. We observe that GenAI-assisted coding would trigger a paradigm shift in programming landscape, which necessitates developers to take on new roles revolving around supervising and guiding GenAI, and to focus more on setting high-level objectives and engaging more towards innovation.},

Consequently, there is a lack of a systematic study that benchmarks state-of-the-art models for a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. In our work, we systematically evaluate two models, ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and compare their performance with human tutors for a variety of scenarios. We evaluate using five introductory Python programming problems and real-world buggy programs from an online platform, and assess performance using expert-based annotations. Our results show that GPT-4 drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and comes close to human tutors' performance for several scenarios. These results also highlight settings where GPT-4 still struggles, providing exciting future directions on developing techniques to improve the performance of these models.},

            The integration of different technologies for formative assessment activities into the classroom is very important for the effectiveness of learning and teaching processes. This study is an experimental study in which the student teachers designed jupyter notebooks as formative assessment activities for specified aims and subject contents. For this purpose, student teachers were enabled to design various formative assessment activities with various packages that were developed with the open-access programming languages included in the jupyter notebooks and external applications that were integrated into the jupyter notebooks. We measured the differences in student teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and attitudes towards the design of jupyter notebooks for formative activities before and after the implementation with questionnaires. According to the results of the study, we found positive and statistically significant differences in the self-efficacy beliefs and attitudes of student teachers from various disciplines who participated in the seminar. During the practical activities, we observed student teachers' prejudices and concerns about programming. This process was accompanied by their lack of prior knowledge and prejudices about the open source programming. Despite the difficulties in the learning process, the student teachers designed and developed various jupyter notebooks for different formative assessment activities at the end of the semester.},

In this article, it is proposed that a visual output approach is suitable based on the current millennials affinities for graphics and visuals. The proposed VJava Module is developed via the application of two main learning theories, which are, the cognitive load theory and constructivism. There are two submodules which consist of eight chapters that cover the topics Introduction to Programming and Java, Object Using Turtle Graphics, Input and Output, Repetition Structure, Selection Structure, More Repetition Structures, Nested Loops and Arrays. To enable Java programs to produce graphical and animated outputs, the MJava library was developed and integrated into this module. The module is validated by three Java programming experts and an instructional design expert on the module content, design and usability aspects.},

A lot of factors are taken into consideration in choosing an introductory programming language. This work presents the results of a survey of computer science degree programs across the United States. The survey shows not only which introductory programming languages are popular but the reasons behind their popularity. It shows the features that are considered important for an introductory programming language and how well the popular introductory languages support those features. This work shows that some popular educational programming languages do not support some of those features that are considered important.},

	abstract = {Organizations spend millions of dollars on information systems to improve organizational or individual performance, but objective measures of system success are extremely difficult to achieve. For this reason, many MIS researchers (and potentially MIS practitioners) rely on user evaluations of systems as a surrogate for MIS success. However, these measures have been strongly criticized as lacking strong theoretical underpinnings. Furthermore, empirical evidence of their efficacy is surprisingly weak. Part of the explanation for the theoretical and empirical problems with user evaluations is that they are really a measurement technique rather than a single theoretical construct. User evaluations are elicited beliefs or attitudes about something, and they have been used to measure a variety of different "somethings." What is needed for user evaluations to be an effective measure of IS success is the identification of some specific user evaluation construct, defined within a theoretical perspective that can usefully link underlying systems to their relevant impacts. We propose task-technology fit (TTF) as such a user evaluation construct. The TTF perspective views technology as a means by which a goal-directed individual performs tasks. TTF focuses on the degree to which systems characteristics match user task needs. We posit that higher task-technology fit will result in better performance. Further, we posit that users can successfully evaluate task-technology fit. This latter proposition is strongly supported in a survey of 259 users in 9 companies.},

	abstract = {Abstract Software tools to support programmers and maintainers have been touted as potential solutions to the software development and maintenance crisis. Use of these tools is predicted to increase programmer productivity while simultaneously increasing the quality of the resulting software. Unfortunately, programmer use of these tools is lower than expected. We investigate maintenance programmers' choices about using software tools for their maintenance tasks using task–technology fit and fitness-for-use models. Our results indicate that the fit between maintenance tool functionality and the needs of maintenance tasks is associated with tool use. Two related factors, however, have stronger effects. First, the results are stronger for intention to use than for actual use. Specifically, while higher fit between tool and task is highly associated with intention to use, this intention may not lead to actual use. Second, maintainers' control over their environment affects usage. The more control maintenance programmers have over their resources and opportunities to use tools, the more likely they are to choose to use them. These results should concern maintenance managers who have acquired or are acquiring tools to increase productivity and quality, but are not realizing the benefits of their technology investments. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This study aims to understand the likelihood of the cloud-based collaborative learning technology adoption within educational environments. Reviewing cloud computing research, technology characteristic construct was divided into collaboration, mobility, and personalization. Based on the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model, this study tested a theoretical model encompassing seven variables: collaboration, mobility, personalization, task non-routineness, task interdependence, task-technology fit, user adoption. Purposive sampling was used and data were collected from 86 undergraduate and postgraduate students who had experiences in using cloud-based applications for collaborative activities. The results indicated that task non-routineness, collaboration, mobility, and personalization have positive significant effects on TTF. However, distinct from past studies, task interdependence positively influences TTF. In addition, results indicated that the significant effect of TTF on users' intention to adopt cloud-based collaborative learning technologies was considerable.},

Thus, this study investigates the effect of achieving fit when implementing game mechanisms on learning outcomes by applying the well-known task-technology fit theory (TTF). TTF is frequently employed to improve fit between tasks to be completed and the technology applied. The findings indicate that achieving gamification fit can reduce the cognitive load of students and result in enhanced learning performance in terms of learning outcomes. Data collected from 266 participants were analyzed using the technique of the partial least squares to validate the developed research model. The findings of this study can aid educators and educational technology designers in identifying the design mechanisms and characteristics that can be used to ensure design fit on gamification platforms.},

	abstract = {Computer systems cannot improve organizational performance if they aren't used. Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.},

	abstract = {The primary objective of this study is to examine an integrated model of continuance intention within the context of task-technology fit (TTF) model and technology acceptance model (TAM); to empirically test this integrated model in explaining students’ continuance usage intention of web-based educational tools. To this end, Malaysia’s Ministry of Education has set a theme of Higher Education 4.0: Knowledge, Industry and Humanity as a pledge in the effort to revamp the higher education ecosystem in Malaysia. The elements, inter alia, is to implement 21st century pedagogy incorporating the latest teaching and learning technologies. Parallel with this initiative, the usage of Web 2.0 interactive educational tools has gained a significant recognition in Malaysia’s higher education in recent years. A new model integrating TTF model and TAM is introduced in this study. This study applied quantitative survey in the main data collection. Purposive sampling technique was used, and the data collection was conducted in a public university via Google Forms. In this study, SmartPLS is used to analyse the data. Even though the findings are partly hypothetical, it is inspiring to reveal an integrated conceptual model in exploring consumer behavioural intention related to Malaysia’s higher education context. It is hoped that the findings will suggest the legitimacy of the integrated framework and insights in Malaysian users’ continuance intention about adopting Web 2.0 educational tools.},

The technology acceptance model has long been used to examine the acceptance of utilitarian systems. Recently, it has been used to examine recreational or pleasure-oriented systems. Many examples exist of software that, depending on the context of use, can be used for productive and pleasurable interaction. This paper examines the determinants of use of one such “dual” system. A survey of users of a dual system was conducted. Results show that perceived usefulness is more important in determining intention to use than perceived enjoyment, and that perceived ease of use has no direct impact on intention, but still has a strong indirect effect.},

	abstract = {This research paper contributes to the computing education research community’s understanding of Generative AI (GenAI) in the context of introductory programming, and specifically, how students utilize related tools, such as ChatGPT. An increased understanding of students’ use is mandatory for educators and higher education institutions, as GenAI is here to stay, and its performance is likely to improve rapidly in the near future. Learning about students’ use patterns is not only crucial to support their learning, but to develop adequate forms of instruction and assessment. With the rapid advancement of AI, its broad availability, and ubiquitous presence in educational environments, elaborating how AI can enhance learning experiences, especially in courses such as introductory programming is important. To date, most studies have focused on the educator’s perspective on GenAI, its performance, characteristics, and limitations. However, the student perspective, and how they actually use GenAI tools in course contexts, has not been subject to a great number of studies. Therefore, this study is guided by the following research questions: (1) What do students report on their use pattern of ChatGPT in the context of introductory programming exercises? and (2) How do students perceive ChatGPT in the context of introductory programming exercises? To address these questions, computing students at a large German university were asked to solve programming tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT as part of their introductory programming course. Students (n=298) provided information regarding the use of ChatGPT, and their evaluation of the tool via an online survey. This research provides a comprehensive evaluation of ChatGPT-3.5’s application by novice programmers in a higher education context. The findings reveal that while students widely adopt GenAI, their use varies significantly, ranging from acceptance of generated solutions to dynamic, and critical engagement. Therefore, this work has implications for educators designing guardrails or forms of instructions on the use of GenAI tools in the classroom.},

	abstract = {As computational thinking (CT) becomes increasingly acknowledged as an important skill in education, self-directed learning (SDL) emerges as a key strategy for developing this capability. The advent of generative AI (GenAI) conversational agents has disrupted the landscape of SDL. However, many questions still arise about several user experience aspects of these agents. This paper focuses on two of these questions: personalization and long-term support. As such, the first part of this study explores the effectiveness of personalizing GenAI through prompt-tuning using a CT-based prompt for solving programming challenges. The second part focuses on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a GenAI model in a semester-long programming project. Our findings indicate that while prompt-tuning could hinder ease of use and perceived learning assistance, it might lead to higher learning outcomes. Results from a thematic analysis also indicate that GenAI is useful for programming and debugging, but it presents challenges such as over-reliance and diminishing utility over time.},

	abstract = {A major challenge facing the world is the provision of equitable and universal access to quality education. Recent advances in generative AI (gen AI) have created excitement about the potential of new technologies to offer a personal tutor for every learner and a teaching assistant for every teacher. The full extent of this dream, however, has not yet materialised. We argue that this is primarily due to the difficulties with verbalising pedagogical intuitions into gen AI prompts and the lack of good evaluation practices, reinforced by the challenges in defining excellent pedagogy. Here we present our work collaborating with learners and educators to translate high level principles from learning science into a pragmatic set of seven diverse educational benchmarks, spanning quantitative, qualitative, automatic and human evaluations; and to develop a new set of fine-tuning datasets to improve the pedagogical capabilities of Gemini, introducing LearnLM-Tutor. Our evaluations show that LearnLM-Tutor is consistently preferred over a prompt tuned Gemini by educators and learners on a number of pedagogical dimensions. We hope that this work can serve as a first step towards developing a comprehensive educational evaluation framework, and that this can enable rapid progress within the AI and EdTech communities towards maximising the positive impact of gen AI in education.},

Employing a mixed methods approach, the research combined topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and qualitative thematic analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of institutional responses to GenAI. Topic modeling identified four core topics: Integration of GenAI in Learning and Assessment, GenAI in Visual and Multimodal Media, Security and Ethical Considerations in GenAI, and GenAI in Academic Integrity. These themes were further explored through sentiment analysis, which revealed highly positive attitudes towards GenAI across all institution types, with significant differences between faculty and student-targeted guidelines. Qualitative thematic analysis corroborated these findings and provided deeper insights, revealing that 94\% of universities had faculty guidelines emphasizing the importance of establishing and communicating course-specific GenAI policies. This analysis also highlighted recurring themes such as academic integrity and privacy concerns, which aligned with the security and ethical considerations identified in the topic modeling. The study highlights the rapid evolution of GenAI guidelines in higher education and the need for flexible, stakeholder-specific policies that address both the opportunities and challenges presented by this technology.},

Differently from previous work, our classifier is capable of detecting AI-written code across 10 different programming languages with a single machine learning model, maintaining high average accuracy across all languages (84.1\% \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 3.8\%).Together with the classifier we also release H-AIRosettaMP, a novel open dataset for AI code stylometry tasks, consisting of 121 247 code snippets in 10 popular programming languages, labeled as either human-written or AI-generated. The experimental pipeline (dataset, training code, resulting models) is the first fully reproducible one for the AI code stylometry task.

Such questions are of particular interest to educators, who worry that these tools enable a new form of academic dishonesty, in which students submit AI-generated code as their work. Our research explores the viability of using code stylometry and machine learning to distinguish between GPT-4 generated and human-authored code. Our dataset comprises human-authored solutions from CodeChef and AI-authored solutions generated by GPT-4. Our classifier outperforms baselines, with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.91. A variant of our classifier that excludes gameable features (e.g., empty lines, whitespace) still performs well with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.89. We also evaluated our classifier on the difficulty of the programming problem and found that there was almost no difference between easier and intermediate problems, and the classifier performed only slightly worse on harder problems. Our study shows that code stylometry is a promising approach for distinguishing between GPT-4 generated code and human-authored code.},

	abstract = {Large language models like ChatGPT can generate humanlike code, posing challenges for programming education as students may be tempted to misuse them on assignments. However, there are currently no robust detectors designed specifically to identify AI-generated code. This is an issue that needs to be addressed to maintain academic integrity while allowing proper utilization of language models. Previous work has explored different approaches to detect AIgenerated text, including watermarks, feature analysis, and fine-tuning language models. In this paper, we address the challenge of determining whether a student’s code assignment was generated by a language model. First, our proposed method identifies AI-generated code by leveraging targeted masking perturbation paired with comprehensive scoring. Rather than applying a random mask, areas of the code with higher perplexity are more intensely masked. Second, we utilize a fine-tuned CodeBERT to fill in the masked portions, producing subtle modified samples. Then, we integrate the overall perplexity, variation of code line perplexity, and burstiness into a unified score. In this scoring scheme, a higher rank for the original code suggests it’s more likely to be AI-generated. This approach stems from the observation that AI-generated codes typically have lower perplexity. Therefore, perturbations often exert minimal influence on them. Conversely, sections of human-composed codes that the model struggles to understand can see their perplexity reduced by such perturbations. Our method outperforms current open-source and commercial text detectors. Specifically, it improves detection of code submissions generated by OpenAI’s text-davinci-003, raising average AUC from 0.56 (GPTZero baseline) to 0.87 for our detector.},

This study first presents an empirical analysis to investigate the effectiveness of the existing AI detection tools in detecting AI-generated code. The results show that they all perform poorly and lack sufficient generalizability to be practically deployed. Then, to improve the performance of AI-generated code detection, we propose a range of approaches, including fine-tuning the LLMs and machine learning-based classification with static code metrics or code embedding generated from Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Our best model outperforms state-of-the-art AI-generated code detector (GPTSniffer) and achieves an F1 score of 82.55.

	abstract = {We summarize the ability of a program autograding system to detect programs written by ChatGPT, rather than by students, in a CS1 class using a “many small programs” approach. First, we found ChatGPT was quite good at generating correct programs from a mere copy-paste of the English programming assignment specifications. However, running ChatGPT using 10 programming assignments and acting as 20 different students, and using zyBooks’ APEX tool for academic integrity, we found: (1) ChatGPT-generated programs tend to use a programming style departing from the style taught in the textbook or by the instructor, and these “style anomalies” were automatically detected. (2) Although ChatGPT may for the same assignment generate a few different program solutions for different students, ChatGPT often generates highly-similar programs for different students, so if enough students in a class (e.g., 5 or more) use ChatGPT, their programs will likely be flagged by a similarity checker. (3) If students are required to do all programming in the autograder’s IDE, then a student using ChatGPT ends up showing very little time relative to classmates, which is automatically flagged. (4) Manually, we observed that if a student consistently uses ChatGPT to submit programs, the programming style may vary from one program to another, something normal students don’t do; automation of such style inconsistency detection is underway. In short, while there will no doubt be a nuclear arms race between AI-generated programs and the ability to automatically detect AI-generated programs, currently it is likely that students using ChatGPT in a CS1 can be detected by automated tools such as APEX.},

	abstract = {AbstractDuring the coronavirus disease‐2019 (Covid‐19) pandemic, many universities have adopted online exam proctoring technologies to monitor and control an increasing number of student cheating incidents. Although it looks like a natural and effective solution for a fair assessment of student online learning performance, the authors argue that proctoring technologies are rooted in problematic assumptions about educational fairness and authoritarian pedagogical approaches. The authors have conducted a qualitative case study in a large‐sized, top‐tier university in South Korea to investigate the negative impacts of adopting proctoring technologies on student subjectivities, pedagogical relationships and educational outcomes, which have not been fully discussed in previous studies. By utilising Foucault's theorisation of disciplinary governmentality, the authors effectively demonstrate that the binary subjectification of students as cheaters and the cheated has degraded the value of student engagement in university education whilst creating more competitive and distrusting relationships amongst students and between students and teachers. Nevertheless, without challenging the unethical consequences of online proctoring technologies or fundamentally unfair social and educational systems, students willingly accept and adopt them as docile bodies, which has led to educational deterioration rather than innovation.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicThere is an increasing number of online exam proctoring technologies available with advanced technical features.During the coronavirus disease‐2019 (Covid‐19) pandemic, many universities have adopted online exam proctoring technologies with exam‐related policies and regulations to stop student cheating behaviours.Previous studies have discussed both advantages and disadvantages of adopting online exam proctoring technologies, including specific ethical concerns.What this paper addsOnline exam proctoring technologies are deeply rooted in problematic educational approaches such as teacher‐centred knowledge transmission.The adoption of online exam proctoring technologies has produced negative impacts on student subjectivities, pedagogical relationships and educational outcomes.Focusing on student cheating as an individual and interpersonal problem neglects the more fundamental issue of social and educational inequality.Implications for practice and/or policyThe negative consequences and damages created by the adoption of online exams and online exam proctoring technologies need to be carefully reflected.The notion of academic fairness needs to be approached with a broader perspective, considering the different social and academic circumstances each student is in.It is essential to critically engage students with the broader conversation about educational fairness to develop them as critical thinkers and future leaders in their chosen fields.},

While this can help understand the learning material and assist with exercises, educators are voicing more and more concerns about an overreliance on generated outputs and lack of critical thinking skills. It is thus important to understand how students actually use generative AI and what impact this could have on their learning behavior. To this end, we conducted a study including an exploratory experiment with 37 programming students, giving them monitored access to ChatGPT while solving a code authoring exercise. The task was not directly solvable by ChatGPT and required code comprehension and reasoning. While only 23 of the students actually opted to use the chatbot, the majority of those eventually prompted it to simply generate a full solution. We observed two prevalent usage strategies: to seek knowledge about general concepts and to directly generate solutions. Instead of using the bot to comprehend the code and their own mistakes, students often got trapped in a vicious cycle of submitting wrong generated code and then asking the bot for a fix. Those who self-reported using generative AI regularly were more likely to prompt the bot to generate a solution. Our findings indicate that concerns about potential decrease in programmers’ agency and productivity with Generative AI are justified. We discuss how researchers and educators can respond to the potential risk of students uncritically over-relying on Generative AI. We also discuss potential modifications to our study design for large-scale replications.

This paper presents results from a series of semi-structured interviews with 12 students and 6 instructors about their awareness, experiences, and preferences regarding the use of tools powered by generative AI in computing classrooms. The results suggest that Generative AI (GAI) tools will play an increasingly significant role in computing education. However, students and instructors also raised numerous concerns about how these models should be integrated to best support the needs and learning goals of students. We also identified interesting tensions and alignments that emerged between how instructors and students prefer to engage with these models. We discuss these results and provide recommendations related to curriculum development, assessment methods, and pedagogical practice. As GAI tools become increasingly prevalent, it's important to understand educational stakeholders' preferences and values to ensure that these tools can be used for good and that potential harms can be mitigated.},

	abstract = {A recent study has found that malicious bots generated nearly a quarter of overall website traffic in 2019 [102]. These malicious bots perform activities such as price and content scraping, account creation and takeover, credit card fraud, denial of service, and so on. Thus, they represent a serious threat to all businesses in general, but are especially troublesome for e-commerce, travel, and financial services. One of the most common defense mechanisms against bots abusing online services is the introduction of Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA), so it is extremely important to understand which CAPTCHA schemes have been designed and their actual effectiveness against the ever-evolving bots. To this end, this work provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field of CAPTCHA schemes and defines a new classification that includes all the emerging schemes. In addition, for each identified CAPTCHA category, the most successful attack methods are summarized by also describing how CAPTCHA schemes evolved to resist bot attacks, and discussing the limitations of different CAPTCHA schemes from the security, usability, and compatibility point of view. Finally, an assessment of the open issues, challenges, and opportunities for further study is provided, paving the road toward the design of the next-generation secure and user-friendly CAPTCHA schemes.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to empirically examine the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) model by adding “personalization” as one of the antecedents, as well as a moderator to determine the key factors for the continuous use intention of mobile news applications (apps). For this study, an online and manual sample survey of 309 respondents, who had used the news app earlier, was collected and analyzed, using quantitative methods such as explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and Hayes process for finding moderating effects among variables. The findings of the direct effect demonstrated that performance expectancy (PE) has the most influential effect on continuous use intention, followed by habit (HT), hedonic motivation (HM), and facilitating conditions (FC). Furthermore, the outcome of tests for the moderating effect of personalization between UTAUT2 constructs and continuous use intention (CUI) showed that personalization has a significant moderating effect on performance expectancy and habit. Therefore, this research establishes the key role of PE, HT, HM, and FC as main factors that trigger the users’ continuous use intention of news apps and provides an integrated framework to assess the moderating effect of personalization on technology acceptance. The findings of the research expand the existing literature on news applications and provide foundation for future research studies in the area of mobile news apps.},

To estimate structural equation models, researchers generally draw on two methods: covariance-based SEM (CB-SEM) and partial least squares SEM (PLS-SEM). Whereas CB-SEM is primarily used to confirm theories, PLS represents a causal–predictive approach to SEM that emphasizes prediction in estimating models, whose structures are designed to provide causal explanations. PLS-SEM is also useful for confirming measurement models. This chapter offers a concise overview of PLS-SEM’s key characteristics and discusses the main differences compared to CB-SEM. The chapter also describes considerations when using PLS-SEM and highlights situations that favor its use compared to CB-SEM.},

	abstract = {Programming courses in computer science play a crucial role as they often serve as students’ initial exposure to computer programming. Many university students find introductory courses overwhelming due to the vast amount of information they need to grasp. The traditional teacher-lecturer model used in university lecture halls frequently leads to low motivation and student participation. Personalized gamification, a pedagogical approach that blends gamification and personalized learning, offers a solution to this challenge. This approach integrates gaming elements and personalized learning strategies to motivate and engage students while addressing their individual learning needs and differences. A comprehensive literature review analyzes 101 studies based on research design, intervention, outcome measures, and quality assessment. The findings suggest that personalized gamification can enhance student cognition in programming courses by boosting motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes. However, the effectiveness of personalized gamification depends on various factors, including the types of gaming elements used, the level of personalization, and learner characteristics. This article offers insights into designing and implementing effective personalized gamification interventions in programming courses. The findings may inform educators and researchers in programming education about the potential benefits of personalized gamification and its implications for educational practice.},

	abstract = {Comics is emerging as a popular medium for providing visual explanations of programming concepts and procedures. Recent research into this medium opened the door to new opportunities and tools to advance teaching and learning in computing. For instance, recent research on coding strip, a form of comic strip with its corresponding code, led to a new visual programming environment that generates comics from code and experience report detailing various ways coding strips can be used to benefit students' learning. However, how comics can be designed and used to teach programming has not yet been documented in a concise, accessible format to ease their adoption. To fill this gap, we developed a cheat sheet that summarizes the pedagogical techniques and designs teachers can use in their teaching. To develop this cheat sheet, we analyzed prior work on coding strip, including 26 coding strips and 30 coding strip design patterns. We also formulated a concept-language-procedure framework to delineate how comics can facilitate teaching in programming. To evaluate our cheat sheet, we presented it to 11 high school CS teachers at an annual conference for computer studies educators and asked them to rate its readability, usefulness, organization, and their interest in using it for their teaching. Our analysis suggests that this cheat sheet is easy to read/understand, useful, well-structured, and interests teachers to further explore how they can incorporate comics into their teaching.},

This study used a modified version of social cognitive theory with self-evaluations as an intermediate variable to explore and resolve the problems associated with applying the theory of planned behavior to explain students’ adoption of technology for self-directed learning. We surveyed 285 college students who enrolled in an e-book publishing course using multifaceted technological learning tools. We found that, as an intermediate variable, self-evaluation enhanced the influence of intentions on behavior and improved the accuracy of predictions of college students’ adoption of technology for self-directed learning. Students’ attitudes and perceived behavioral control were important factors influencing their adoption of technology for self-directed learning through their effects on intention; subjective norms were not important in this respect.},

The research employed document analysis and interview data from middle level managers (deans), curriculum designers and educational technologists. The findings suggest that, except for one faculty where educational technology was an enduring feature of the design and delivery of curricula programs, technology played a peripheral role in the design and reorganization phases although it featured more in the implementation of curricula programs under STEPS. The paper concludes that the innovative use of technology, a holistic teaching and learning strategy, and training of educators on technology integration are critical in achieving total integration of educational technology into curricula programs.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of ICT in South African basic education has not been associated with effective pedagogical uses of ICT in classrooms. While there is differential deployment of ICT as cognitive tools of instruction in South Africa's schools, the effects of educators' ICT self-efﬁcacy on their pedagogical use of technologies is yet to be fully grasped. This research gap has been attributed to, inter alia, the lack of a detailed proﬁle of ICT self-efﬁcacy beliefs of educators and its effects on pedagogical uses of ICT by educators. This study employs a crosssectional survey, adapting a structured questionnaire to investigate the relationship between purposively selected 163 Gauteng educators' ICT self-efﬁcacy beliefs and their pedagogical use of ICT. An exploratory factor analysis on pedagogical use of ICT (PUI) revealed three factors of ‘traditional PUI’ and one ‘constructivist PUI’. Results suggest that ICT self-efﬁcacy had a positive signiﬁcant but moderate effect on the three traditional PUI and a positive signiﬁcant and strong relationship with the constructivist PUI. Furthermore, a linear regression analysis found ICT self-efﬁcacy to signiﬁcantly predict all four PUI factors. The study recommends initial educator training that emphasises exposure of trainee educators to extended periods of hands-on engagement with ICTs in classroom environments. Furthermore, it recommends continuous ICT integration and the development of practicing educators with a focus on the “how to” integrate ICT tools as ‘generative’ mind tools. These interventions have potential to increase educators' ICT self-efﬁcacy in resource constrained contexts. The implication is that educator training curricula are re-designed with an emphasis on practical lesson planning that includes ICTs as seamless resources used in the classroom in basic education.},

While prior research explored various aspects of code generation, the focus on security has been limited, mostly examining code produced in controlled environments rather than open source development scenarios. To address this gap, we conducted an empirical study, analyzing code snippets generated by GitHub Copilot and two other AI code generation tools (i.e., CodeWhisperer and Codeium) from GitHub projects. Our analysis identified 733 snippets, revealing a high likelihood of security weaknesses, with 29.5\% of Python and 24.2\% of JavaScript snippets affected. These issues span 43 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories, including significant ones like CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values, CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code, and CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting. Notably, eight of those CWEs are among the 2023 CWE Top-25, highlighting their severity. We further examined using Copilot Chat to fix security issues in Copilot-generated code by providing Copilot Chat with warning messages from the static analysis tools, and up to 55.5\% of the security issues can be fixed. We finally provide the suggestions for mitigating security issues in generated code.},

            This paper presents two complementary quantitative studies examining the integration of generative AI (GenAI) tools into programming courses in higher education. Study 1 investigated undergraduate students’ perceptions of GenAI tools, focusing on usefulness in coursework, creativity enhancement, behavioral intention to use, and concerns and critiques. Study 2 evaluated undergraduate students’ performance in correcting code generated by large language models (LLMs) during programming exams, comparing this performance to their results on instructor-designed programming tasks. Findings from Study 1 revealed generally favorable student perceptions of GenAI. Participants reported medium-to-high levels of perceived usefulness, particularly emphasizing GenAI’s potential to enhance learning efficiency and support creative problem-solving. Students also expressed strong intentions to continue using GenAI tools in their studies, while reported concerns were relatively low and centered primarily on the risk of over-reliance. Findings from Study 2 showed that students encountered significantly greater difficulty when correcting LLM-generated code compared to traditional exam tasks, highlighting the unique challenges posed by AI-generated outputs in assessment contexts. Taken together, the results suggest that while students recognize the value of GenAI tools in supporting learning and creative exploration, programming education must also focus on developing students’ skills in critically evaluating and correcting AI-generated content to ensure effective and responsible integration.},

	abstract = {This paper extends the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines to provide criteria for assessing if software conforms to best practices in open source. By adding “USE” (User-Centered, Sustainable, Equitable), software development can adhere to open source best practice by incorporating user-input early on, ensuring front-end designs are accessible to all possible stakeholders, and planning long-term sustainability alongside software design. The FAIR-USE4OS guidelines will allow funders and researchers to more effectively evaluate and plan open-source software projects. There is good evidence of funders increasingly mandating that all funded research software is open source; however, even under the FAIR guidelines, this could simply mean software released on public repositories with a Zenodo DOI. By creating FAIR-USE software, best practice can be demonstrated from the very beginning of the design process and the software has the greatest chance of success by being impactful.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of Open Educational Resources (OER) constitutes an essential element for establishing education as a “public good” on the internet. A core objective of OER is to broaden access to educational material and improve the overall quality of teaching and learning. In this manner, OER contributes to the sustainable (re)use and (re)distribution of (educational) resources. The goal of sustainability is also visible in the latest UNSECO recommendation concerning OER, which intends to support the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, namely SDG 4 (Quality education). The support of SDG 4 is combined with the call to create sustainability models for OER at national, regional and institutional levels and the planning and pilot testing of new sustainable forms of education and learning. As a result, several repositories and referatories for OER provision have been developed and tested in educational institutions worldwide. However, each of these platforms contains only a relatively limited number of resources. In our article, we argue that when considered through the lens of learning innovation and sustainable development, it would be necessary to increase the discoverability of available resources at the different locations and platforms that currently are visible to only a limited number of teachers and students. To achieve this goal, the focus needs to shift from the creation and growth of new and competing platforms to intelligent ways of linking and increasing their interconnectedness. We use the concept of “learning ecosystems” to illustrate this approach of interconnected resources. Ecosystems go beyond the spatial dimension of learning by focussing on actors’ diversity and interactions. Digital (networked) learning technology is part of an ecosystem and has itself to be understood as an actor. However, we discuss that ecosystems should be reflected with caution as they can themselves entail opening and closing mechanisms. Therefore, ecosystems that rely on mechanisms of opening their contents to other platforms can realise the full potential of open learning. We describe the implications of the concept of a distributed ecosystem by presenting case studies that show how technical solutions, including metadata standards and plugins, can link contents in repositories and referatories within ecosystems. The overarching objective is that the different repositories and referatories expand and improve the sustainable use of OER by merging into a distributed learning ecosystem.},
